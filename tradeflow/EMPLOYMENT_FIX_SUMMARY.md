# Employment Data Fix Summary

## Problem
The `trade_impact.py` script was incorrectly combining employment data with different units, causing massive inflation of employment numbers:

- **Employment people:** factors use "1000 p" units (thousands of people)
- **Employment hours:** factors use "M.hr" units (million hours)

The old code combined these directly without unit conversion, leading to unrealistic results like 614+ billion employed people for China.

## Solution
Fixed in `/Users/helix/Library/Data/webroot/exiobase/tradeflow/trade_impact.py` around lines 71-88:

### Before (Problematic)
```python
'Employment_total': ['Employment people:', 'Employment hours:'],
```
This mixed different units in a single column.

### After (Fixed)
1. **Separated** employment into two distinct columns:
   - `Employment_people_total`: People count (converted to actual people)
   - `Employment_hours_total`: Hours worked (in million hours)

2. **Applied proper unit conversion**:
   ```python
   # Employment people (convert from 1000 p to actual people)
   employment_people_converted['impact_value'] = employment_people_converted['impact_value'] * 1000
   
   # Employment hours (keep as M.hr)
   employment_hours_impact = employment_hours_factors.groupby('trade_id')['impact_value'].sum()
   ```

## Results
- **Employment people**: Now shows realistic numbers (e.g., China ~0.6-0.8 billion people)
- **Employment hours**: Properly tracked separately in million hours
- **No more unit mixing**: Each metric maintains its proper scale and meaning

## Files Modified
- `/Users/helix/Library/Data/webroot/exiobase/tradeflow/trade_impact.py` - Main fix
- Added validation tests to verify the logic

## Impact
This fix eliminates the need for frontend scaling workarounds and provides accurate employment data in CSV outputs.
