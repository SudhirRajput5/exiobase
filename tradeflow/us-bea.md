# US Interstate Trade 

### US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Integration with Exiobase international tradeflow

The US-BEA data integration here combines Exiobase MRIO data with US Bureau of Economic Analysis API data to generate relational trade flow tables. This system extends our existing exiobase/tradeflow architecture to include detailed US trade analysis with enhanced state-level and industry-specific insights. Developed by referencing [US generate_import_factors.py](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO/tree/master/import_emission_factors).

The following US BEA integration with Exiobase international trade flow data uses the [industry.csv file](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/blob/main/year/2019/industry.csv) from the separate Exiobase pull of US domestic commodity flow. Industry columns are: industry_id and name (the exiobase sector information).

## Tables Name and Column Design (for .csv import to SQL)

CSV Output preview resides in [trade-data/year/2019/US
/domestic](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/tree/main/year/2019/US/domestic)

### Trade Tables

IMPORTANT: The following TO DOs are updates to existing python processes. Don't add new processes that clean-up and rename within existing .csv files. Files will be generated as fresh output from the existing python.  Don't add extra python, add options existing.

See our [BEA Python's Validation Readme](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/blob/main/year/2019/US/bea-report.md) for latest output overview.

Here are the table and column names we're aiming for:

#### [trade.csv](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/blob/main/year/2019/US/domestic/trade.csv) -  trade for country

For entire country (split by domestic, import and export)

trade_id, year, region1, region2, industry1, industry2, amount

- **trade_id**: 5-value composite key (year, region1, region2, industry1, industry2)
- Links to other tables as primary foreign key

Originates in our [international pull (from Exiobase)](../)

TO DO
Add a note here on whether the BEA data pull makes use of the international "trade" table in domestic.
The state-to-state "interstate" table is similar to the international "trade" table.


#### interstate.csv - Rename from [bea_trade_detail.csv](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/blob/main/year/2019/US/domestic/bea_trade_detail.csv)

<!--
trade_id, bea_commodity_code, bea_industry_code, trade_balance, import_value, export_value, trade_partner_state, transport_mode
-->
trade_id, year, region1 (US-AK), region2 (US-GA), industry1, industry2, amount, 
bea_commodity_code, bea_industry_code, economic_multiplier

TO DOs
Rename bea_trade_detail.csv to "interstate" in the us-bea.py python.
Use the region naming format: [country]-[state] for the interstate.csv output.

TO DO - Remove "bea_" from these column names and explain use here:
bea_commodity_code
bea_industry_code
economic_multiplier

The "interstate" table has the same structure as the international "trade" table.
In some SQL installs, we'll place state data in the "trade" table with multi-country trade data.


#### interstate_factor - rename from [state_trade_flows.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/refs/heads/main/year/2019/US/domestic/state_trade_flows.csv) (State-Level Analysis)
trade_id, origin_state, destination_state, state_industry_code, flow_value, flow_type, employment_impact

TO DO:
1. Change from "state_trade_flows" to "interstate_factor".
2. Add interstate_id column
3. Remove origin_state and destination_state column (those are now at interstate.region1 and interstate.region2 in the interstate table).

#### [trade_price_indices.csv](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/blob/main/year/2019/US/domestic/trade_price_indices.csv) (Economic Indicators)
trade_id, import_price_index, export_price_index, exchange_rate, price_year, currency_adjustment_factor

TO DO
Why is the table above empty?

#### [industry.csv](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/blob/main/year/2019/industry.csv) (industry category names)
industry_id, name, category

Used by all countries and states. Industry Mapping - using existing file

*Note: Resides at the root of the annual directory (year/2019/industry.csv) and is generated by other Python scripts in the tradeflow folder. The BEA process uses this existing file instead of generating a separate [bea_industry_mapping.csv file](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/blob/main/year/2019/US/domestic/bea_industry_mapping.csv) - delete that.  The 'name' column contains the exiobase sector names that were previously in the exiobase_sector column.*


#### trade_factor_bea.csv (BEA-Specific Factors) 

trade_id, factor_id, coefficient_value, bea_multiplier, regional_adjustment, data_source

TO DO: Where is the file above?

Similar to [trade_factor.csv](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/blob/main/year/2019/US/domestic/trade_factor.csv)

TO DO

When csv file and column names are changed above, update [Sample Report from Output](../../trade-data/bea-dashboard/)


#### [flow.csv](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/blob/main/year/2019/flow.csv) (FEDEFL Integration)
flow_uuid, flowable, context, unit, compartment, flow_class, preferred, external_reference

"flow" was included here to review. It will NOT be a SQL table. 
The "[flow](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/blob/main/year/2019/flow.csv) " table is NOT in our relational data structure since it resides in "trade", "interstate" and "factor"

Probably NOT useing here. Replaced by our "[factor](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/blob/main/year/2019/factor.csv)" table.
And in our table naming, "[trade](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/blob/main/year/2019/US/domestic/trade.csv)" and "interstate" contain the trade flow (currently [state_trade_flows.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/refs/heads/main/year/2019/US/domestic/state_trade_flows.csv)).



### Analytical Enhancement Tables

These won't be needed in SQL since the can be table joins.

#### [export_competitiveness.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/refs/heads/main/year/2019/US/exports/export_competitiveness.csv) (Export Analysis)
trade_id, revealed_comparative_advantage, export_sophistication_index, market_share, growth_rate

#### [import_dependency.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/refs/heads/main/year/2019/US/imports/import_dependency.csv) (Import Analysis)  
trade_id, import_penetration_ratio, supply_chain_vulnerability, alternative_suppliers, strategic_importance

#### [state_industry_impacts.csv](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/blob/main/year/2019/US/domestic/state_industry_impacts.csv) (State Economic Impact)

state_code, industry_code, direct_jobs, indirect_jobs, induced_jobs, total_output_impact, tax_revenue_impact

TO DO: Rename "state_code" to "region" and prepend the country

region (US-AK)

## Processing Pipeline

### Phase 1: Base Data Generation
1. **Exiobase** (leverage existing trade.py patterns)

   - Reuse pre-generated trade.csv with trade_id structure (was extracted from Exiobase Z, Y, F matrices by auto-downloading IOT_[year]_pxp.zip)
   - Use existing industry.csv and factor.csv reference files from parent directory

### Phase 2: BEA API Enhancement
2. **BEA Data Retrieval**
   - Fetch trade data by commodity and partner country
   - Retrieve state-level export statistics  
   - Pull industry input-output relationships
   - Download price indices and economic indicators

### Phase 3: Integration and Analytics  
3. **Data Integration**
   - Map Exiobase sectors to BEA industry codes
   - Reconcile trade values between data sources
   <!-- This can be done later with SQL
   - Create comprehensive industry concordance
   - Generate enhanced trade factor coefficients
   -->

### Phase 4: State-Level Disaggregation
4. **State Analysis**
   - Disaggregate national flows to state level using BEA data
   - Calculate state-specific employment impacts
   - Analyze export competitiveness by state and industry (also to be done in SQL)
   - Create import dependency assessments

### Phase 5: Relational Output Generation
5. **CSV Table Creation**
   - Generate all relational tables using trade_id links
   - Create FEDEFL-based flow.csv (for reviewing only, not adding Flow ID to other table, using factor_id instead)
   - Output comprehensive state and industry impact tables
   - Ensure data consistency across all tables

## Key Innovations

### 1. Enhanced Relational Structure
- State tables link via interstate_id for comprehensive analysis, including folder size comparisons
- State-level disaggregation maintains interstate_id relationships (separate from trade_id for now)

## Data Quality and Validation

### 1. Cross-Source Reconciliation (on hold until we have in SQL)
- Compare Exiobase and BEA trade values for consistency
- Flag significant discrepancies for manual review
- Apply scaling factors where appropriate

### 2. State-Level Validation
- Ensure state exports sum to national totals
- Validate employment multipliers against BEA benchmarks
- Cross-check industry classifications

### 3. FEDEFL Integration Quality (Not doing currently since not using UUIDs)
- Verify Flow UUID mapping completeness
- Ensure environmental flow consistency
- Validate units and contexts

### 4. Scalability
- Designed for easy extension to other years
- Enables selective processing of specific tradeflows
- Support incremental updates and data refreshes

This specification creates a comprehensive framework that leverages existing Exiobase pre-processing while adding substantial BEA API integration and state-level analytical capabilities. The relational design ensures data consistency and enables complex multi-dimensional analysis of trade flows.



# Trade-Data Repo

Output is deployed in our [trade-data repo](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data) to keep local folders small.

[Intro](https://model.earth/profile/trade/) - output sent to [modelearth/trade-data](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/tree/main/year/2019/US)
trade-data repo receives from python in [exiobase/tradeflow](https://model.earth/exiobase/tradeflow/) and [exiobase/tradeflow/bea](https://model.earth/exiobase/tradeflow/bea/) 

This [EPA download page](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/useeio-models-with-import-emission-factors-for-greenhouse-gases-for-2017-2022-from-exiobas) is helpful for clarifying the difference between commodities, BEA service categories and sectors. (3 crosswalk files from that page were added to our [trade-data/concordance](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/tree/main/concordance) folder.)

The EPA page provides these crosswalks:  
(1) EXIOBASE commodities to USEEIO commodities.  
(2) BEA service category data to USEEIO sectors.  
(3) EXIOBASE Country/Region to BEA Service, Census Goods and TiVA trade regions.  

The differences between "CEDA Sector" and the new USEEIO_Detail 2017 sector are small.  
"CEDA Sector" and "USEEIO_Detail 2012" both correspond to NAICS 2012. 
Whereas USEEIO_Detail 2017 split Aluminum into 2 categories and combined 4 Appliance categories. (See notes below)

**NOTES**

CEDA only provides emission data, and doesn't convey the 2017 NAICS splits and merges done by the US EPA for USEEIO2.

We don't use industry_id for the USEEIO or BEA values since neither refer to their data as Industry. (Though it is NAICS industry categories with minor modifications.)

Hence, for easy table names with the Exiobase data, we use "industry" (5-char) and "commodity" (6-char).

There are too many meanings for "sector" to warrant giving it a table. (Plus sector IDs change every 5 years.)  "beasummary" is more clear.

The crosswalks above correspond to the US EPA reports here:

https://model.earth/exiobase/tradeflow/bea/

You could focus on running our bea scripts above to create .csv files so we can review before SQL tables are created, and also add the crosswalks from the first link above to our trade-data repo.

CEDA still uses NAICS 2012:

[This ceda_to_useeio_commodity concordance](https://pasteur.epa.gov/uploads/10.23719/1531906/documents/ceda_to_useeio_commodity_concordance.csv) provides the 2012, CEDA Sector, and 2017


NAICS USEEIO_Detail 2017 has these differences:

Household Appliance Consolidation:
The 2012 NAICS Codes 335221, 335222, 335224 and 335228 for Household Cooking Appliance, Household Refrigerator and Home Freezer, Household Laundry Equipment and Other Major Household Appliance Manufacturing are all combined in 2017 to the single NAICS Code: 335220, "Major Household Appliance Manufacturing" by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Aluminum Manufacturing:
The 2012 NAICS Code 331313 was split into 2017 NAICS 331313 and 33131B for reclassification in the aluminum manufacturing sector, where CEDA retains the older detailed classification while USEEIO 2017 uses a modified code (33131B).
